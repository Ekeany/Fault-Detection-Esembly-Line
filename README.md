# Fault-Detection-Esembly-Line
In this practical exercise, we are dealing with a bottling production line in a facility bottling CocaCola for the Irish domestic market. We have a set of images, taken under near constant factory lighting conditions, of the bottles as they leave the bottling line. The bottling company require a vision system to automatically identify a number of specific faults that may occur during the filling, labelling and capping stages of production so that these bottles can be intercepted prior to packaging. Your task is to design and prototype a vision system to detect the set of fault conditions that may occur together with identifying the type of fault that has occurred. You will develop this prototype system using the software and the techniques discussed in the course.
